# Dynamic Flask Form
Having struggled to find a workind example of a WTForm in Flask with
a dynamic form, I created this one. It is cobbled together from a few
Stackoverflow and Google Group discussions.

**I'm a total noob so if you have suggestions I'd be glad to include them!**

## What does it do?
- Render a form with two models
- Save and load the related models

**This means you can have a form with dynamically created fields which are
saved and loaded properly.**

## Usage
You can use **requirements.txt** to install the packages, preferably in a virtualenv.
Then you can simply run **multimodel.py**. The default port is set to 5002.

## Basic Concepts
- FieldList and FormField are used to nest one Form inside another
- **`phones`** is a relation in the **`User Model`** creating a link to **`Phone entries`**.
- **`PhoneForm`** deals with the Phone fields only
- **`CombinedForm`** includes the **`User`** and **`Phone`** fields
- The `CombinedForm` is populated through the `User` model and related `phones`

### Pain Points
#### User Model
I had named the `phones` relation `phone` for a while which broke the populate_obj
function. The naming must match for the mechanism to work. Duh.

#### PhoneForm
This is the form that is nested in the 'main' Form. It is not directly exposed
or rendered. A common problem here is the CSRF token being missing from this form.
Options to solve this problem are [explained here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15649027/wtforms-csrf-flask-fieldlist).
I chose to subclass wtforms Form which does not require the token.

#### CombinedForm
`phones = FieldList(FormField(PhoneForm, default=lambda: Phone()))`

That is the line of code where it all broke down for me. Once there is a working
example it's hopefully not so mysterious. Setting the default to `lambda: Phone()`
was difficult for me to get to (see [Fixing populate_obj](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/wtforms/5KQvYdLFiKE/TSgHIxmsI8wJ))

#### Index
I just load the one user from the db, no messing around.
Playing with a dropdown for different users just distracts from the main
point here.

I'm not sure if aassing a new Phone instance where the User has no phones is the
best possible solution but it meant I could keep using the JavaScript Code as it was.

#### Javascript
I simply fixed example code that I found. There is probably a neater way of copying the fields
that I haven't found. I would gladly take suggestions in this case as well as the rest of the code.

# Dynamic Flask Form
The code 'app.py' enables dynamic addition of form-fields ie. this feature can be very well used in case where the input parameters become dynamic. All the entries that are made get stored in the database 'app.db' from which data can be easily accessed using sqlite. A demo video of the same can be found <a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwrSYlOsMCyWMmJ0aEdQR0tfNWs">here.</a><br/>
